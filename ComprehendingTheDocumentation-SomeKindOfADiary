
Every Vulkan process needs:
- at least one instance
- at least a physical device (any Vulkan capable GPUs on the host)
- at least a logical device (through which we can communicate with the physical one)
- a family of queues on which we can store function calls that will be run asynchronously
- a swap chain (some kind of a framebuffer)

For degugging purposes validation layers can be used.
Their behaviour can be  changed using the Vulkan Configurator that
comes with the LunarG Vulkan SDK.
